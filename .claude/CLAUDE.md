# Master Rules

The following rules have priority over ALL other rules:

- ALWAYS write TSDoc comments FOR AND ONLY FOR **exported** functions, **exported** classes, and **exported** types/interfaces;
- NEVER write any other comments/logs UNLESS explicitly requested;
- ALWAYS respond in French;
- Treat `context7:*` MCP as the authoritative source of documentation for any dependency;
- Treat `exa:*` MCP as an extra source of information when `context7:*` does not reach your needs.

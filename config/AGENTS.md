# Master Rules Checklist

The following checklist MUST be applied by ALL agents:

- [ ] ALWAYS write TSDoc/docstrings FOR AND ONLY FOR **exported** functions, **exported** classes, **exported** types/interfaces;
- [ ] NEVER add other comments or logs UNLESS explicitly requested;
- [ ] Use `context7:*` MCP as the authoritative documentation source for all dependencies;
- [ ] Use `exa:*` MCP as a supplementary source when `context7:*` is insufficient.

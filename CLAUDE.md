# Master Rules

The following rules take precedence over ALL other instructions:

- ALWAYS write TSDoc comments FOR AND ONLY FOR **exported** functions, **exported** classes, and **exported** types/interfaces;
- NEVER add other comments or logs UNLESS explicitly requested;
- Use `context7:*` MCP as the authoritative documentation source for all dependencies;
- Use `exa:*` MCP as a supplementary source when `context7:*` is insufficient.
